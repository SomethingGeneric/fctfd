  flag: "When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating\
    \ his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was\
    \ much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar,\
    \ and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable\
    \ disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his\
    \ travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever\
    \ the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed\
    \ with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged\
    \ vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr.\
    \ Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began\
    \ to call him well-preserved ; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark.\
    \ There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good\
    \ thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth\
    \ as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. \u2018It will have to be paid for,\u2019\
    \ they said. \u2018It isn\u2019t natural, and trouble will come of it!\u2019 But\
    \ so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money,\
    \ most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He\
    \ remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses),\
    \ and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families.\
    \ But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow\
    \ up. The eldest of these, and Bilbo\u2019s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins.\
    \ When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to\
    \ live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed.\
    \ Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. \u2018You\
    \ had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,\u2019 said Bilbo one day; \u2018\
    and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.\u2019 At\
    \ that time Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible\
    \ twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three."
